1 Introduction
As technology evolves to its current form, digital marketing vehicles have become the most effective way for businesses to promote their products or services. Mediums such as social media and blogging platforms have been rising in popularity, proving their ability to elevate businesses' marketing efforts. Amongst these digital marketing mediums exist landing pages, a place where businesses can freely communicate to their potential customers, or visitors, what their business is about. Through landing pages, businesses can interact with their customers in unique ways, which is different than their social media pages or blogging articles. This distinctive ability has turned landing pages into one of the most important parts of the success of modern digital marketing.
Looking more closely into the subject, landing pages themselves also have multiple components, and some of them are more important than others when it comes to their overall success. Better wording in copies can better describe its business details to its visitors. The right graphics can make the industry's buzzwords more meaningful to novice visitors. A well-organized information hierarchy can pull visitors away from being lost in the jungle of words. And likewise, an effective selection of pictures can convey more meaning to potential customers than "a thousand words". This research has gone through a series of user experiment (UX) tests and surveys to better understand images, one of the most important components of landing pages. There exists previous research about the topic of images, or visual design as a whole, across many forms of digital mediums; however, the design of images is often discussed, rather than image performances. Images can spike visitors' attention and focus them on certain locations on the landing page where the images are placed (Ash et al 2012). Images also help businesses explain more about their products and services, sometimes faster than words can. This makes pictures a crucial component in landing pages, especially in Software-as-a-Service businesses (SaaS), the business model that this paper will focus on studying landing pages for. SaaS businesses provide software to users over the Internet. And because software, is the heart of their service, most of the time can be harder to describe through text. This characteristic makes images an important component on SaaS landing pages, and if used effectively, can make a notable difference in the overall performance of the landing pages.
The objective of this article is to quantify the impact of image performance on SaaS landing pages' success, by studying the relation between users’ behaviours and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as bounce rate and conversion rate, and to answer some questions: How image performance, such as load time and quality, affect user engagement on landing pages when their performances are not ideal? Can users better tolerate a landing page consists of slow-loading or blurry images?
The topic of research is applicable to be studied in various industries that take in the use of landing pages, but to limit variables and narrow the focus, this research aims towards the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) industry and their landing pages. The article will be split into multiple parts that will guide the reader through the research processes, including research method declaration, exploring research results, analysis of the findings, and then the final discussions on the overall findings and how should the study of this topic proceeds.

    2 Method
The topic of study has been widely studied by researchers in industries that concerns about improvements of web performances. But even though that is the case, not much available data is applicable for the characteristic of this study, which is focused specifically on the quantifiable metrics of image performances. This is the reason why a new experiment is needed to be conducted, producing a specific dataset to be gathered and analysed for this study.
        2.1 Research design

The experiment and the dataset of this study has served the purpose of answering the two questions of research. To achieve such goal, the experiment has gathered a combination of quantitative and qualitative dataset. The experiment had two main sections that all participants had gone through. The experiment started with the introduction phase, where the participants are informed about what the study is about, and what to do in during the experiment, they were leaded into the first phase. This is where a landing page of a SaaS product was presented to them. 

The participants were instructed to browse the page with the goal of understanding what the product is about. The reason for this instruction is that with a task to perform, participants are more likely to pay more attention to the experience. In contrast, the subjects would not pay much attention if they’re freely browsing without a task to perform. This conclusion was reached after multiple pilot tests that yielded results of less time on page, indicating the low attention that the participants have given into the experience.

Then the subjects answered a series of questions related to the experience that they’ve just went through, before continuing to the next section of the experience. In the followed section, the same landing page will be showed to the participants, and their tasks to complete remains the same: pay attention to what the product is about. After the second section, the participants will be asked with the same series of question as they’ve answered in the first section, which when completed, concludes the experiment. 

The difference between the two versions of the same landing page lies on the performance of their images. Although the two versions of the landing page have the same exact texts and images, the images of the first version are noticeably slow but have high quality, whereas the ones in the second version load as fast as subject’s internet bandwidth allows, but their quality is scaled down to where texts in the images are hard to read. 

Because the two versions of the landing page have the same content, and the test subjects have the same task to perform in both phases, the first phase is predicted to provide more reliable data points. This is because this first version is their first impression of the landing page, and the participants will have more natural behaviour. This mode of behaviour can be compared to users in real life behave when entering a landing page for the first time. When this first version of the landing page is viewed, the participants were likely to be familiarized with the products and the descriptions of it, so their second time viewing the page will be faster because they can already expect what the page is about. This first-impression aspect is the reason why the experiment must also cycle between the two versions of the landing page, alternating the version being shown first between participants. As the result of this additional step, the answers to the second research question can become clearer.

To further achieve the neutral response of the participants, the product introduced in the experiment needs to be a more neutral one. Since participants have different views towards different products, due to the differences in their needs at the time of testing, results can be too varied if the type of product is too emotionally attatched. By seleecting a more neutral product to put into the experiment, the images and texts that describes it on the landing page also are also needed to be neutral. Pictures should not include faces in them, and texts should not include languages that are too emotionally stimulating. When put into effect, the neutral choice of product, images, and texts will elevate the dramatic performance of the images, in order catch participants' attention, and create a more memorable perspective of the images for a more on-topic result.

    2.2 Sampling
In the time of writing, browsing websites is an intergrated activity in most of our lives, no matter what the age is. But each age group have tendencies to behave differently than one another when it comes to browsing websites. 
(((Example claims needed source here))

Due to the limited size and resource of this research, its study group is narrowed to a specific demographic group, consist of university students with ages ranging from 20 to 27 years old. This demographic group, like any other demographic group, have distinct internet browsing habits that can be lightly generalized. Because they have adapted to the internet for a large part of their life, they know what to expect from a website such as the landing page in the experiment. Their mode of browsing landing pages is mostly skimming, and slowing down only when something on the page catches their interest. Their tollerance level of slow loading or low quality websites are varied from person to person like any other demographic groups, but overall they lean towards the lower end. Products that are not in interest, lengthly description texts, low quality visuals are skipped because of this low tollerance level. This is also the reason why instructing a task for the participants to do can also help extracting more information that allign to the natual behaviour outside of the study.

3 Data
    3.1 Data Collection
There are two distinct section that data are being collected from the experiment, at the landing pages that the participants view and the survey they answered. 

When the subjects enters either one of the two landing pages, their mouse activities are starting to be recorded, including their mouse hovering positions and their click counts. To optimize the speed of the experiment and to make the dataset easier to handle, each elements of the website are assigned with a counter that increases when the mouse is hovered on them and when they are clicked. The alternative to this design is to record these hovering time and click count based on mouse positions, then calculate what element lies on those positions on the server. This alternative option is less optimal because the data weight of each participants increases on O^n time (((What O time??? Put source here))), whereas the data weight of the chosen option stay constant no matter how long the subjects stay on the page.

After the participant finishes viewing each version of the landing page, a series of questions about the landing page they have just viewed are presented to them. The questions asked the participants for their overall experience of images on the landing page they have just viewed, both on their sharpness and load speed. In the middle of the series of question, the participant is asked for why they spend most of their time on the page hovering over a specific element, which can help confirming the hypothesis in the analysis phase. Overall, the two surveying sections of the experiment are meant to clarify their behaviours and better understand their feelings towards each version of the landing page.

    3.2 Data Presentation
After being cleansed and organized, there are ___ remaining entries for each of the version of the landing page 
In each of those entries, there are ___ elements have been counted for clicks, and ___ sections hovering time have been measured. Using the selecetion of these data points will help reveal the answers for both of the research questions.

The surveying parts of the experiments are there for both contribute to the analyzation of the interaction dataset and to support the claims that arrives from such analyzation. Because these questions are asked right after the landing pages are being viewed, participants can evaluate the experience they have just been through and give accurate answers

4 Analysis
With the collected dataset, the study can apply some analysis onto them to understand subjects' behaviours, an through that, to answer the two research questions. With the two research questions as the aim to achieve, this analysis will also be splitted into two sections. Successfully answering the first question with partly provide a path to answer the second one, as the dataset have been understood more clearly.

    4.1 The impact of image performance
Before jumping into the specific analysis of the dataset, there is a need to zone in the focus area of the it. The first time in the experiment that the participant see the landing page is the one that is more suitable for analysing, as it is their first impression of the content of the webpage. 

After that, to determine the impact of image performance on participants views of the landing pages, the first aspect that need to be indentified is how what the subject is paying attention to when they browse. Assuming that the more the subject hover over an element, the more attention they have put onto that element. On the other hand, the less hover time the element has, the less attention it has been put on by the participant.

    3 Glossary
To ease the research, a foundational understanding of concepts was developed. With the help of this list of glossaries, crucial keywords can be elaborated for a better study of the article. The following list of glossaries is aimed towards the research topic of landing pages in SaaS businesses.
        3.1 Landing Page
Landing pages are webpages belong to individuals or organizations, with the purpose for potential visitors to "land" on after clicking through its link from various other digital platforms, such as newsletters or social media platforms (Mailchimp, 2020). After accessing a landing page, visitors can be further informed about the service or product, exchange their information for trial services, subscribe to the business's newsletter, or contact the vendor for more information (Sameer, 2022). Being a part of the business's main website, or a separate page deliberately designed to capture visitors from across the internet, landing pages are the foremost element in driving the conversion of the business (T. Ash, M. Ginty, R. Page, 2012).
        3.2 Software-as-a-Service
According to Kumar (2017), traditional software business models of licensing prebuilt software are gradually declining, being progressively supplanted by the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. SaaS applications, as Kumar notes, are delivered to their users through the Internet. Because of that characteristic, SaaS applications offer fewer installation procedures on the user's end and simplify the maintenance process. Furthermore, since the cost of maintaining the software is centralized in the Cloud, users may benefit from reduced prices for the end product that they're using.
        3.3 Key Performance Indicator
Being one of the most important components in a SaaS business marketing toolkit, and the one that can raise notably in cost, landing page performance should be measured precisely. And like other parts of the business that need to be closely monitored, metrics can be a useful tool to do such job. Landing page performance metrics, which are usually named Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), are a list of quantifiable metrics that indicate how effective the operations of a part of the business are performing (Ekholm 2020). The following is the collection of KPIs that are correlated to the success of SaaS landing pages.
        3.4 Conversion Rate
When browsing the webpage, the visitor makes many interactions with the page from scrolling, mouse hovering to clicking on multiple locations on the page. If the visitor makes an interaction desired by the webpage's designer, a "conversion" is then considered successful (Saleem et al. 2019, 589).
        3.5 Bounce Rate
When entering a landing page, visitors can either interact with the elements of the page or do nothing and leave the page and move on to their next browsing task. This event is called a "bounce", and might happen due to their poor experience after entering the page. Bounce rate can be measured by taking out the amount of visitors who leave the page after a period of time without interacting anything with it. A low bounce rate can result in a lower ranking in search engines, poor user experiences, and ultimately leads to lower profits from landing pages (Sculley et al. 2009).
        3.6 Time on page
Time on page is the amount of time a visitor spends on a webpage before exiting it. The metric is useful for assessing the page's engagement and content effectiveness, and through that, its ability to retain visitors (Arora 2024).
        3.7 Scroll Depth
Apart from when the webpage fits completely in the height of the viewport, the visitor has to scroll down below the initial position when entering the page to experience more of what the webpage has to offer. To determine how far the visitor has scrolled down on a specific page, scroll depth can be implemented in the overall measurements. Scroll depth is connected to how engaging the page is to users, and with low scroll depth, the webpage is unlikely to retain its visitors (Grothusen 2020).
