                <p>Now a series of web pages will be presented to you.</p>
                <p>When something doesn't response or do so poorly, it is likely <span class="highlight">not because of your device.</span>
                So don’t worry and continue browsing - this just means it’s not meant to be clickable or still loading.</p>
                <p>Please go through the page just like how you'd normally do when browisng the internet.</p>
                <p>Try to remember how you feel about the web page, as you will tell those feelings again at the end of this experience.</p>
                <p class="highlight">When you don’t want to browse the webpage anymore, please close that tab by clicking the banner at the top of the page to continue.</p>
                <p>When you click the "<span class="highlight">Next</span>" button bellow, the first version of the web page will appear.</p>
